# My rusty journey

Welcome to My rusty journey repository! This is a place where I document my progress and experiences while learning the Rust programming language.

Rust is a systems programming language that is designed to be safe, concurrent, and fast. It is a great choice for building high-performance applications and libraries, and is widely used in industry.

In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that demonstrate the concepts and techniques learned in several Rust tutorials. It has material
from:

1. [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/);
2. [Arkworks ecosystem](https://github.com/arkworks-rs).
